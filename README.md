# Bioinformatic Analysis of Amplicons

**Author**: Julio Ram√≠rez Guerrero

## Overview
This project involves the bioinformatic analysis of soil amplicon sequences using QIIME2. The objective is to process raw sequence data, perform quality filtering, denoise, and analyze the diversity of the microbial community. The project also explores the correlation between alpha diversity and soil relative humidity.

## Prerequisites
Ensure the following are installed:
- QIIME2 (version 2023.9)
- Conda

## Steps

### 1. Setup

### 2. Data Import

### 3. Quality Filtering

### 4. Denoising

### 5. Clustering and Analysis

### 6. Diversity Analysis

## Conclusions
**Sequence Retention:** 7.69-73.83% of non-chimeric sequences were retained after quality filtering, indicating suboptimal data quality.
**Correlation with Humidity:** Positive correlation between soil relative humidity and prokaryotic diversity (Spearman's test statistic: 0.4255, p-value: 0.0152).
**ASV Detection:** 524 ASVs detected in the study.
This analysis provides insights into the microbial community structure and its relationship with environmental factors such as soil moisture.
